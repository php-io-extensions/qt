# Overview

`PhpSlot` = a `QObject` subclass holding a PHP callable. `QObject::connect()` normalises the signature (`QMetaObject::normalizedSignature`), finds the signal with `indexOfSignal`, and calls `QMetaObject::connect(sender, index, slot, QObject::staticMetaObject.methodCount(), Qt::DirectConnection)`. Activation arrives in `PhpSlot::qt_metacall`; after `QObject::qt_metacall` subtracts QObject's own methods the id is 0, which invokes the callable. No moc, no generated metaobject.[^qobject]

Arguments, typed by the signal's `QMetaMethod::parameterMetaType`: bool, integer and float types as PHP scalars; `QString`/`QByteArray` as strings; `QSocketDescriptor` as the int fd; enums as ints; `QObject*` boxed. A `QObject*` that is the emitting sender maps to the sender's own wrapper even during `destroyed()`, when Qt has already cleared its QPointers.[^runtime]

Lifetime:

* Slots live in a per-request list. The sender's `destroyed` `deleteLater`s its slot.
* `QObject::disconnect(Connection)` severs the connection, frees the callable, and deletes the slot (`deleteLater` when called from inside a callback).
* `QMetaObject\Connection` going out of scope does not disconnect, as in Qt.
* `QTimer::singleShot(msec, callable)`: the slot is the functor's context; it fires, frees the callable, `deleteLater`s itself.
* RSHUTDOWN deletes every remaining slot (disconnecting it) and frees its callable while the engine can still free it.

`QEventFilter` is a `PhpSlot` subclass overriding `eventFilter()`: it shares the slot's call path and request-end teardown, and filters by event type in C++ so unlisted events never reach PHP.

A callable that throws leaves the exception pending; later callbacks in the same Qt call are skipped and the exception surfaces when `processEvents`/`exec` returns to PHP.
